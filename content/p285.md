When promoter Kyle Swick of Irrelevant Music arranged the inaugural Irrelevant Music Fest in 2015, it was a labor borne of both love and discontent. “The concept behind this celebration sort of came about via the disappointment of seeing all these big business celebrations appearing in Atlanta, and not seeing a ton of regional love on the costs,” Swick informed us in an interview. “I wished to do a fest for Atlanta music, about Atlanta music, and cost effective to local music fans and artists alike.” [![](http://www.progressiveavenues.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/irrevelant-music-festival-atlanta-194x300.jpg)](http://www.progressiveavenues.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/irrevelant-music-festival-atlanta.jpg)

With 20 bands spread out across 3 days and two venues, the lineup was extensive but not extremely so, and it had the tendency to concentrate on artists with which Irrelevant Music had actually constructed a working relationship. Completion outcome was an occasion that felt more like a celebration and gathering of buddies than it did a conventional celebration.

Musically, the acts lean to punk and indie rock, however with Pyramid Club, Sequoyah, Pamela\_and her boys, and Mannequin Lover all slated to perform, Atlanta’s underground electronic and industrial noises will be well represented. If you had to point to a shortage in the lineup it would be an absence of regional hip-hop, although Awful Records’ Lord Narf will be there at some point to launch the celebration into the stratosphere.

You may also have observed that the second edition Irrelevant Music Fest has broken somewhat from last year’s locals-only mantra to consist of a handful of out-of-town artists. That may rub a few individuals the wrong way, but it’s actually difficult to complain when those acts consist of can’t-miss bands like angular mind-blowers Palm, DKA stalwarts Boy Harsher, and grunge pop trio Daddy Issues. Have a look at the full lineup on the flyer below.

Another change, nevertheless, that will bug substantially more individuals, is the shift in location from the all ages Drunken Unicorn to the 21+ just Earl. That will leave younger fans out in the cold, although all programs at 529 will remain 18+. On the positive side, a post on Irrelevant Music’s Facebook page notes that next year “will be less age limited for sure,” which indicates Irrelevant Music Fest III is just 365 days away.

The Festival starts on July 20-22 and it’s SOLD OUT already.
